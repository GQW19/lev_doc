## Use image

### 1 Add a new mode for Hello World

Now that you've learned to add modes for your tool, it's time to make your `hello world` tool cooler.

It would be really cool if you could say "Hello World" in mathematical language! That's it, let's add a new mode to `hello world` - "exp".

In this mode, we want `hello world` to print the value of e with different precisions according to the content the user inputs.

> e refers to the natural logarithm, also known as Euler's constant

### 2 Add exp mode
While the goal is cool, it's not easy to achieve it, especially when you realize you don't understand `Euler's constant`.

Fortunately, there are many algorithm engineers and computer scientists who have calculated Euler's constant (and complex mathematical processes such as calculus using code), and with a simple search we can find a powerful Python library - NumPy, its official website address is [numpy.org](https://numpy.org/).

Next, we can add an exp mode to `hello.py`:

```python
@annot.meta(
    desc="Exp",
    params=[annot.Param("name", "person name")],
    cats=[Attck.Reconnaissance],
)
def exp(lenth: int = 9) -> Cr:
    """
    The third tool mode of Hello World
    ```
    await exp(9)
    ```
    """
    @levrt.remote
    def entry():
        import numpy
        res = round(numpy.e, length)
        ctx.set(msg=res)

    return Cr("alpine:latest", entry=entry())
```

### 3 Build image

The `exp` mode we just added won't work because the `numpy` library has not been installed.

So next, we have to figure out how to use the `numpy` library, remember the introduction in Chapter 1 - "How Leviathan works"?

> The working principle of Leviathan is to **achieve standardized distribution by containerizing security tools, and through closures, distributing logic codes to distributed network containers to achieve standardized invocations and interactions**.

Therefore, here we need to build a container image that supports the `numpy` library. We only need to write a very simple Dockerfile. We can place the Dockerfile in the `whtcjdtc2008.hello_world` directory. The content of the Dockerfile is as follows:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10.4-bullseye
RUN pip install numpy
```

In the same directory as Dockerfile, enter the following command to build the image:

```bash
docker build .
```

After the image is built, you can see the following output:

```bash
[+] Building 37.5s (6/6) FINISHED

```

### 4 Modify the exp mode

Through the previous step, we have successfully built the image, the image id is `86cf129873f235fe67ec9b19ebded0f69750128d9eaba50a1ff9258b6dc4bdd0`, use the following command to enter the image container and find the installation path of scipy:

```bash
docker run --rm -it 86cf12987 /bin/bash
find / -name numpy
```

You can get the installation path of `numpy` lib:

```
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy
```

> Q: Why are you looking for the installation path of numpy lib?
>
> A: Although the tool code is composed of python, the runtime environment of the tool code is not the built-in python environment of the image container. Therefore, in order to allow the runtime environment of the tool code to load num lib, we need to manually specify the lib loading path.

> Note: It should be noted that the runtime environment of the tool code is python3.10, so the installed external lib also needs to support python3.10 and above.

Next, we make a simple transformation to the `exp` function:

```python
@annot.meta(
    desc="Exp",
    params=[annot.Param("name", "person name")],
    cats=[Attck.Reconnaissance],
)
def exp(length: int = 9) -> Cr:
    """
    The  third tool mode of Hello World
    ```
    await exp(9)
    ```
    """
    @levrt.remote
    def entry():
      import sys
      sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages')
      import numpy
      res = round(numpy.e, length)
      ctx.set(msg=res)

    return Cr("86cf12987", entry=entry())
```

There are two main places to change:

1. The first is to add the path for the system to search lib, so that the runtime environment of the tool code can index the `numpy` library installed when we build the image;

2. The second is to modify the image name used in the `Cr(...)` function, from `alpine:laest` to the image we built earlier;

### 5 Local testing

With a simple modification to `main.py`, the tests can be run locally:

```python
import levrt
from lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world import hello

async def main():
    doc = await hello.exp(9)
    data = await doc.get()
    print(data["msg"])


if __name__ == "__main__":
    levrt.run(main())
```

Test with `pdm run python main.py`:

```bash
┌─[hunter@192] - [~/Workspace/lev_hub/whtcjdtc2008.hello_world] - [10108]
└─[$] pdm run python main.py                                                             [21:42:47]
2.718281828
```

You can see that the `hello world` tool is using `Euler's constant` to say hello to the world!
