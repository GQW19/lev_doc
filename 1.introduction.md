## General Introduction To Leviathan Framework

### Introduction to Leviathan

Leviathan is an online platform for the sharing and usage of cybersecurity tools. It includes widespread well-known tools, niche tools, and tools developed/trimmed by community contributors.

Relying on MongoDB database and Docker, Leviathan can aggregate a variety of cybersecurity tools to realize integrated attack&defense capabilities. Docker's encapsulation of tools simplifies the process of building environment. MongoDB aggregates test results from different tools. Leviathan provides the diversity of tools and users. In other words, Leviathan saves users from complicated tool installation and environment configuration. With one click, users can launch multiple tools to fulfill tasks like asset detection, or even some simple automated cybersecurity tasks.

Leviathan supports Python which is easy to learn and use. The entire coding process is based on templates designed by Leviathan. Only a small portion of core code needs to be written to complete the development of tool integration & workflow.

Leviathan can bind developers' GitHub accounts with one click. The engine invokes the dockerfile hosted by the developer on GitHub. Therefore, developers do not need to re-upload code/ image or repeat image version control on Leviathan.

The dockerfile written by developers can be built directly on the proprietary image management system of Leviathan, without using local computing resources. Images uploaded by developers can be managed directly on Leviathan.

In addition, Leviathan allows developers to package and encapsulate the entire tool folder as a whole, and uploads it to Leviathan. Tool users can easily invoke any user-written open package in their own workflow on a per-package basis.

### Word introduction

1. Tool

   Scripts and applications that are used by developers to perform specific functions, such as nmap, checkamrc, etc.

2. Mode

   A mode is the encapsulation of a tool. A cybersecurity tool usually has many parameters. Every time when it is used, it may require to query and construct these parameters by using a combination of documents, which takes a lot of time and efforts. That's why mode is very useful.

   On Leviathan, you can encapsulate parameters (or some common and fixed parameter names, commands, or usage methods of tools) into specific functions.

   These encapsulated functions are the mode.

   E.g:

   ```bash
   $ nmap -sS -Pn -p- -T4 --open -O -oX /tmp/port_os.xml 192.168.1.1/24
   ```

   This command can be wrapped as a mode of the nmap.

3. Workflow

   Workflow is a collection of tool modes.

   When a specific penetration task is being conducted,it may require multiple tools or multiple mode simultaneously for certain purpose. But these combinations can actually be abstracted and automated, so they can be integrated into a function, which is also called workflow.
   
### Data storage and security

Leviathan will create a mongodb database locally through docker, and persist the task data to mongodb in the form of json. You can invoke and use it at any time. Leviathan will not upload your data to the Internet without permission.

### Agent role

Create a message queue locally. The message queue middleware is integrated in the agent. All the user information, including tasks created by the user, task execution process, state changes, etc., will be stored in the message log. 

### Why does Leviathan use async workflow?

Leviathan considers various user scenarios and tries to smooth the learning curve. The asynchronous workflow is considered to have the most efficient and optimized solution for various application scenarios. Besides, there are async components in the components utilized by Leviathan.

### What did Cr do?

The Cr() function returns a Cr object. Cr project defines a container, but doesn't started the container. When the await method is executed, Cr will create a new task inside the container, then start executing the logic in the entry() method, and finally store the execution result in mongodb.

### The role of Docker

Containerization technology facilitates the deployment of tools and provides lightweight isolation. It relatively ensures the integrity of system environment and tool dependencies when the tool is executed. And it avoids the interference of different operating systems as well as different environments.
