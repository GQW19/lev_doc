## General Introduction To Leviathan Framework

### Introduction to Leviathan

Leviathan is an online platform for building, sharing and deploying cybersecurity tools. It includes widespread well-known tools, niche tools, and tools developed or revised by community contributors.

Relying on MongoDB database and Docker, Leviathan can aggregate a variety of cybersecurity tools to realize integrated testing capabilities. Docker offers software encapsulation which simplifies the process of setting up the environment for each tool. MongoDB aggregates test results from different tools. Leviathan promotes the diversity of tools and users. In other words, Leviathan saves users from complicated tool installation and environment configuration. With one click, users can launch multiple tools to fulfill tasks like asset detection and simple automated cybersecurity tasks.

Leviathan supports Python which is easy to learn and use. The entire coding process is based on templates designed by Leviathan. Only a small portion of core code needs to be written to complete the development of tool integration & workflow.

Developers can connect their GitHub accounts to Leviathan with one click and let Leviathan invoke the dockerfile hosted on GitHub. Therefore, developers do not need to re-upload their code/image file or repeat image version control on Leviathan.

Dockerfiles written by developers can be built directly on the proprietary image management system on Leviathan, without using local computing resources. Images uploaded by developers can be managed directly on Leviathan.

In addition, Leviathan allows developers to package and encapsulate the entire tool folder as a whole, and uploads it to Leviathan. Tool users can easily invoke another user's open-source package in their own workflow on a per-package basis.

### Word introduction

1. Tool

   Scripts and applications that are used by developers to perform specific functions, such as Nmap, checkdmarc, etc.

2. Mode

   A mode is the encapsulation of a tool. A cybersecurity tool usually has many parameters. Every time a tool is used, the user may need to look up documentations on different commands and parameters, which could take a lot of time and effort. That's why mode is very useful.

   On Leviathan, you can encapsulate parameters (or some common and fixed parameter names, commands, or usage methods of tools) into a specific function.

   These encapsulated functions are the mode.

   E.g:

   ```bash
   $ nmap -sS -Pn -p- -T4 --open -O -oX /tmp/port_os.xml 192.168.1.1/24
   ```

   This command can be wrapped as a mode of Nmap.

3. Workflow

   Workflow is a collection of tool modes.

   Multiple tools or modes might be required simultaneously for a specific penetration task. However, these combinations can actually be abstracted, automated, and integrated into a single function, which is also called a workflow.


### Data storage and security

Leviathan will create a MongoDB database locally through docker. The task data will persist in the local MongoDB in the form of json files. You can access your data at any time. Leviathan will not upload your data to the Internet without permission.

### Agent role

Leviathan will create a local message queue middleware which is integrated in the agent. All the user information, including tasks created by the user, task execution process, state changes, etc., will be stored in the message log. 

### Why does Leviathan use async workflow?

Leviathan considers various user scenarios and tries to smooth the learning curve. The asynchronous workflow is considered to have the most efficient and optimized solution for various application scenarios. Besides, Leviathan itself contains async components.

### What did Cr do?

The Cr() function returns a Cr object. Cr object defines a container, but doesn't start the container. When the await method is executed, Cr will create a new task inside the container, then start executing the logic in the entry() method, and finally store the execution result in MongoDB.

### The role of Docker

Containerization technology facilitates the deployment of tools and provides lightweight isolation. It relatively ensures the integrity of system environment and tool dependencies when the tool is executed. And it avoids the interference of different operating systems as well as different environments.
