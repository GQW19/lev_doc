### Mac

The underlying technical solution of docker under Mac is implemented by the mac virtual machine, and the nat network mode is used by default. This feature makes it possible to use nmap and other tools for LAN scanning, but in some scenarios, exceptions may occur. Therefore, if your computer's configuration supports, this tutorial suggests that you can firstly consider `virtual machine + Linux` , which is more stable and results in almost no exceptions.

#### Install Docker

If Docker has been installed on your device, please check its version number. Leviathan supports 20.10.10 and above. If the condition is met, you can skip this step, otherwise, please install or update Docker as follows. 

Download the docker installation file (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Click the file to launch docker. Open Docker Desktop by clicking the icon. Docker has a graphical interface under Mac.
When the Docker Logo on the lower left corner is green, it means you have successfully launched Docker.![](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/87fe783c-f999-4b50-85f9-99a0080d6561.png)


#### Install Python3.10

Download the PKG installation package of python3.10 from the official website and click Install. 
Your Mac device may have its own python. After installing python3.10, you need to enter the command `python3.10`, so that python3.10 can start the corresponding version of python correctly. You cannot use the two commands `python`  or `python3` directly, or the wrong version will be started.

After installing python3, please configure the pip source of Tsinghua University.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ mkdir .pip
$ vim .pip/pip.conf
```

Copy and paste the following text and save it:

```toml
[global]
index-url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/
[install]
trusted-host=pypi.douban.com
```



#### Install PDM

PDM is a modern Python package manager that supports [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/)ã€‚PDM is a modern Python package manager that supports PEP 582. It installs and manages packages in a manner similar to npm, in that there is no need to create a virtualenv at all. Leviathan uses PDM to temporarily manage the unpublished packages of tools and workflows locally, and also uses PDM to conduct usability testing of local tools and workflows. To upload tools and workflows in the community also requires the support of PDM. PDM will be introduced below. The installation is related to the user's local configuration. What is PDM?(https://pdm.fming.dev/)
How to install PDM and configure it locally will be introduced below.

1. There are various installation methods under Mac:

   * You can install it directly by using homebrew: `brew install pdm`
   
     brew will directly download the dependencies required by pdm: python3.10 and the six package. Unlike the manual installation of python3.10 above, the python3.10 downloaded by brew will only be stored in pdm's folder. At this time, if you run pdm to execute operation command, it will report an error and remind you to update pip. The packages installed by brew usually have some version errors with the latest packages. Therefore, it requires some manual updates:
`/usr/local/Cellar/pdm/1.13.5/libexec/bin/python3.10 -m pip install --upgrade pip`
   
     If you encounter some weird errors while implementing the methods above, you can also try the following method.
   
   * Use the script provided by the official website to specify the version to install: `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdm-project/pdm/main/install-pdm.py | python3.10 - -v 1.13.4`ï¼Œpdm is now in a rapid iterative process, there may be some problems with certain versions, so you need to specify the version when installing.

   
   


   **Note**: It is not recommended to use the default python or pip command to install pdm directly. Some features of the pdm plugin pdm-lev need the support of python3.10. However, Mac's python version by default is 3.7 or 3.8, and that's what causes many weird errors.

2. After the PDM installation is complete, some actions are required to verify that the PDM tool is installed without problems.

   * Excute the command

      ```bash
      $ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
      ```

     After execution, the terminal returns:

     ```bash
     âœ” Installation succeeds.
     ```

     It means that the installation is successful. If other abnormal situations occur, please check whether the operation is performed correctly according to the previous step.

   * Next perform the second verification step:

     ```bash
     $ mkdir tmp #Create temp folder
     $ cd tmp #Go to temp folder
     $ pdm lev new test.demo #Create a test project
     ```

     After the test project is created,it will be prompted to output:

     ```shell
     Using Python interpreter: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3.10 (3.10)
     Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
     ```

     At this point, it means that the test project has been created successfully.
     
   * Third verification step:

     ```bash
     $ cd test.demo
     $ pdm add levrt
     ```

     If the terminal outputs the followings, it means indicates success:

     ```shell
     Adding packages to default dependencies: levrt
     âœ” ðŸ”’ Lock successful
     Changes are written to pdm.lock.
     Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
     Synchronizing working set with lock file: 17 to add, 0 to update, 0 to remove
      
       âœ” Install aiofiles 0.8.0 successful
       âœ” Install anyio 3.5.0 successful
       âœ” Install certifi 2021.10.8 successful
       âœ” Install charset-normalizer 2.0.12 successful
       âœ” Install idna 3.3 successful
       âœ” Install httpcore 0.14.7 successful
       âœ” Install h11 0.12.0 successful
       âœ” Install httpx 0.22.0 successful
       âœ” Install levrt 1.3.2 successful
       âœ” Install motor 2.5.1 successful
       âœ” Install mpmath 1.2.1 successful
       âœ” Install msgpack 1.0.3 successful
       âœ” Install nats-py 2.0.0 successful
       âœ” Install pymongo 3.12.3 successful
       âœ” Install rfc3986 2.0.0 successful
       âœ” Install sniffio 1.2.0 successful
       âœ” Install sympy 1.10.1 successful
     Installing the project as an editable package...
       âœ” Install lev.test.demo 0.1.0 successful
      
     ðŸŽ‰ All complete!
     ```

     Otherwise, the installation is not successful, please check whether you have followed the previous prompts.
     
     After the test is successful, you can delete the `test.demo` folder.

3. The next step is to enable the pep582 proposal globally. As a result, when the pdm command is executed in the shell, you can press the tab key and the system will promptis automatically. Next, you need to configure pep582 environment variables in a way that fits your own operation system. The following commands are only examples:

   ###### Bashï¼š

   ```bash
   $ pdm --pep582 >> ~/.bash_profile ## Add pdm configuration to the end of .bashrc file
   $ pdm completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/pdm.bash-completion
   $ pdm config install.cache True
   ```

   ###### Zshï¼š

   ```shell
   $ pdm --pep582 >> ~/.zprofile # Add pdm configuration to the end of .zporfile file
   $ pdm config install.cache True
   ```

   ###### Oh-My-Zshï¼š

   ```shell
   $ pdm --pep582 >> ~/.zprofile # Add pdm configuration to the end of .zporfile file
   $ mkdir $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/pdm
   $ pdm completion zsh > $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/pdm/_pdm
   # Then make sure pdm plugin is enabled in ~/.zshrc
   $ pdm config install.cache True
   ```

   Note: In the `ï½ž/.zshrc` file, there is a line: `plugins=(git)`  should be modified to `plugins=(git pdm)`

   ###### Fishï¼š

   ```shell
   $ pdm --pep582 >> ~/.fprofile # Add pdm configuration to the end of .fprofile file
   $ pdm completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/pdm.fish
   $ pdm config install.cache True
   ```

4. Next, configure IDE. Here are two setting methods that enable the IDE to support PDM; PyCharm, VSCode, VSCode is recommended.

   ###### IDE General Settings

   ```bash
   #There is no built-in support or plugins for PEP 582 in most IDEs generally, you have to configure your tools manually.
   #PDM will write the storage project-wide configuration in .pdm.toml, so it is recommended that you add the following line to .gitignore:
   .pdm.toml
   __pypackages__/
   ```

   ###### PyCharm settings

   ```bash
   #Mark __pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib as Sources Root.
   
   #Also, if you want to use tools from the environment (such as pytest), you must add the __pypackages__/<major.minor>/bin directory to the PATH variable of the corresponding run or debug configuration. 
   ```

   VSCode settings

   ```bash
   #Add the following two columns to the top-level dictionary .vscode/settings.json of settings, which can be opened by selecting Edit in settings.json in the vscode interface settings:
   {
     "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"],
     "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"]
   }
   ```

   Note: The `<major.minor>` of the compiler's PDM settings should be the version number of your computer's Python3 when adding the configuration, such as `__pypackages__/3.10/lib`. 

#### python environment dependencies

You may encounter various errors in the next steps, such as:`  No module named 'pdm' ` ,`  No module named 'levrt' ` when running the code.The highly probable cause may be that your python environment dependencies are abnormal.

If you installed pdm through pip, you need to ensure that you use the python interpreter bundled with pip to execute the specific code when running.

If you installed pdm through brew, you cannot use the execution command of the normal python file: `python3.10 main.py`. Instead, you should use the command parameters provided by pdm itself to execute the code: `pdm run python main.py`.


#### Introduction of the pdm-lev plugin

pdm-lev is a pdm plugin provided by Leviathan, which can help you automatically generate projects that meet the requirements of Leviathan. It will greatly improve your efficiency.

pdm-lev does not provide an upgrade method for the time being, and you need to upgrade manually.

```bash
$ pdm plugin remove pdm-lev
$ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
```



At this point, the environment configuration is complete! Let's start the [next step].(#Credential uploading and acquisition)
