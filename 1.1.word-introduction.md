## Word introduction

1. Tool

   Scripts and applications that are used by developers to perform specific functions, such as Nmap, checkdmarc, etc.

2. Mode

   A mode is the encapsulation of a tool. A cybersecurity tool usually has many parameters. Every time a tool is used, the user may need to look up documentations on different commands and parameters, which could take a lot of time and effort. That's why mode is very useful.

   On Leviathan, you can encapsulate parameters (or some common and fixed parameter names, commands, or usage methods of tools) into a specific function.

   These encapsulated functions are the mode.

   E.g:

   ```bash
   $ nmap -sS -Pn -p- -T4 --open -O -oX /tmp/port_os.xml 192.168.1.1/24
   ```

   This command can be wrapped as a mode of Nmap.

3. Workflow

   Workflow is a collection of tool modes.

   Multiple tools or modes might be required simultaneously for a specific penetration task. However, these combinations can actually be abstracted, automated, and integrated into a single function, which is also called a workflow.
