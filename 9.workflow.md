## Workflow

Workflow is an abstract collection of tools. Developers are allowed not to write the tool file: `tool.py` in the package; as a result, what we upload to Leviathan platform will become a "workflow package".

**The so-called multi-tool workflow is actually a program that processes tasks with multiple tools. The results generated by one tool are handed over to the next task for execution, so what matters the most in workflow is `asset.py` .  You will define methods, invoke different modules to execute tasks, and then pass the results to the next task for execution in `asset.py` .**  If you understand these words, then the following content will appear redundant, you can briefly go through it.

### Write workflow

Now, you can start writing  `assest.py` . For more details about the programming examples, please refer to [Various programming examples](#Various programming examples). The following is an example:

````python
from levrt import ctx, Concurrent, annot
from . import nmap	#Import the nmap tool built before

@annot.meta(
    desc="Detect surviving hosts in the LAN and obtain host port information",
    params=[annot.Param("server", "List of ip's for security review", holder='["192.168.1.1/24"]')],
)
async def server_port(ip: str):
    """
    Detect surviving hosts in the LAN and obtain host port information.
    ```
    await server_post("192.168.1.1/24")
    ```
    """
    # First scan the entire IP segment to get the surviving hosts.
    result = await nmap.alive(ip)
    data = await result.get()
    alive = data['alive']
    os_result = []
    task_list = []
    # Multi-threaded scan host port information.
    async with Concurrent() as c :
        for domain in alive:
            print(domain)
            t = c.start(nmap.port_os(domain))
            task_list.append(t)
	# receive results
    for t in task_list:
        t_result = await t
        # Get all the data of this concurrent task
        data = await t_result.get()
        os_result.append(data)
    print(os_reult)
````





## Introduction of \_\_init__.py 

### Module import

In`./lev-hub/username.tool/lev/username/tool/__init__.py`,

here it should be`./lev-hub/szczecin.nmap_python/lev/szczecin/nmap_python/__init__.py`.

Import the module. 
Import our tool invocation and workflow, and the entire file directory will form a relatively complete package structure[^8](#What is the structure of a package?), that is, the package to be uploaded:

```python
from levrt import annot
from . import nmap
# alive_nmap_python,port_os_nmap_python The two workflow functions are in the next document.
from .asset import alive_nmap_python, port_os_nmap_python,server_port
# Export the tool itself, and export the workflow. That is, one tool + two pieces of worflow in the figure below.
# server_port is a customized method, not shown in the figure below
__lev__ = annot.meta([nmap_python, alive_nmap_python, port_os_nmap_python,server_port])
```

If it is the package in Chapter 6 Modeless Invocation, then directly import the alive method defined in tool.py. The code is as follows:

```python
from levrt import annot
from .nmap_python import alive
#  If you only export the tool, Leviathan will only display the tool itself, that is, the two pieces of workflow in the figure below will not be displayed (and the name will be alive( ) method's desc parameter).
__lev__ = annot.meta([alive])
```

### Export module

Different from exporting all the tool files and workflow files of the package, the `__init__.py` file of the workflow package can choose not to export the tools in the package, but only export the workflow files. At this time, the tools in the workflow package will not be published and displayed on Leviathan:

```python
#server (multi-tool workflow module export)

from levrt import annot
from . import nmap #The defined tool can import the workflow calling.
from .asset import server_post

#Only export server_post workflow.
__lev__ = annot.meta([server_post])
```
