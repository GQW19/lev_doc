#### Upload SSH public key

Users of the LEV community need to upload their SSH public key to the LEV platform for user identity authentication.

If you already have an SSH public key, you can use the following command to get the public key information:

> Mac/Linux：
>
> ```bash
> cd ~/.ssh
> ls -la
> cat ~/.ssh/[pubkey file].pub
> ```

If you don't have your own public key, you can generate it with the following command:

> Mac/Linux:
>
> ```bash
> $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "youremail@example.com"
> ```
>
> Windows：
>
> ```powershell
> $ ssh-keygen.exe -t ed25519
> ```
>
> Note: It is not recommended to use the default rsa encryption algorithm to generate a key pair. ed25519 is more secure and is supported by the new version of OpenSSL, whereas rsa will be disabled by default after openssh8.8

Log in to LEV, in `Account Settings` - `Public Key Management`, click `Create SSH Public Key`, copy and submit the content of the public key file.

#### Configure ssh config file

`touch ~/.ssh/config` write the following configuration:

```bash
Host lev
	HostName service.lev.zone
	Port 2222
	User username # Replace username with your LEV username
```

Then enter the `ssh lev` command to verify that the configuration is successful:

```Bash
$ ssh lev
Connection to service.lev.zone closed. # When this message is displayed, the configuration is successful
```

If the following message is returned, there is a problem with the configuration file, please check the previous configuration steps:

```Bash
$ ssh lev
Permission denied (publickey). # If this message is displayed, the ssh public key configuration is incorrect. Please check whether the ssh public key and username are correct
```

If the above process shows an error, you can also enter the following command line directly:

```bash
ssh username@service.lev.zone -p 2222
#  (Replace the username with your LEV username instead of any email!)
```

#### Start

On the Account Avatar - Account Settings - My Device page, select Add Device, enter a name at will, and click Submit.

Next, execute the following command to start the local environment:

```bash
ssh lev agent | docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker --rm -i talentsec/lev
```
This command will automatically pull the image and start the container, and the whole process may take a few minutes.

After the command is executed, you can check the `Account Avatar` - `Account Settings` - `My Device` page, and the device should be online.
