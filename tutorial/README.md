# Welcome to Leviathan

Welcome to the Leviathan platform. On LEV, you can
* Invoke a wide array of cyber security tools and workflows as needed, and **perform cyber security tasks efficiently**

* Stop worrying about the tedious data storage & management of cyber security projects, and let LEV **manage your project data in a secure way**

* Leverage the wisdom of the entire cyber security community, and invoke **intelligent tools and automatic workflow on LEV**

* Learn how the tools and workflows are designed and constructed, and **Learn from peers in the cyber security community**

* Become a tool developer, contribute your experience and wisdom to the community, and **build your reputation in the community*


In this document, I will show you how to use the tools and workflows on LEV. If you are ha'hinterested in becoming a tool developer on LEV, [Developer Guide](https://lev.zone/docs/#/) should be a good start.

Different from most of the traditional online tool platform, LEV separates task scheduling and task operation from the perspective of architecture. Therefore, LEV provides great flexibility for tool usage and integration.

> We put a lot of emphasis on protecting your data and information. Your data security is important to us.

**①Tool invokation and operation**

**②Data production, storage, and demonstration**

The two things above are both depending on users' private local environment. ① & ② don't pass through the cloud server of LEV, which ensures data security and user privacy of each user.

You can think of LEV as your "personal AI cyber security bot". Jobs can be done via very simple instructions (e.g. one-click tool initiation, low-code task arrangement). You don't need to worry about tool download/deployment/invokation/upgrate, nor to write any code, and all tasks shall be completed automatically!

Now, let's start to explore LEV together!
