##  Linux

### 1. Overview of Installation Steps

As shown in the figure, the installation of the development environment is divided into 4 steps. If your environment has already installed some parts in advance, you can skip the corresponding steps and continue the installation from the back.

> Operating Systemï¼šx86_64
>
> Pythonï¼š3.10 and aboveï¼ˆopenssl 1.1.1 and aboveï¼‰

### 2. Install Docker

In order to build a tool, you need to build a tool image for itï¼Œlikewise, to use a tool, users need to enable the image as well. These steps all require Docker to provide the image and container environment. The installation of Docker is described below. 

1. Find the Linux version of the docker installation tutorial on the official Docker download page and operate step by step:[installation tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/);
2. When using the tools and workflows on Leviathan and testing tool/workflow availability, you need to launch Docker firstly;
3. Please confirm that the version of Docker Engine you installed is 20.10.10 or higher. 

### 3. Install development environment

#### Option 1ï¼šRecommended installation method

   ##### CentOS 7/9ï¼š

   Copy the following command and run it directly.

   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_centos.sh && chmod +x lev_installation_for_centos.sh && source ./lev_installation_for_centos.sh

   ```

   ##### CentOS 8ï¼š

   Since the package has been removed from mirror, you need to switch the source to Steam 8. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   dnf --disablerepo '*' --enablerepo extras swap centos-linux-repos centos-stream-repos
   dnf distro-sync
   ```

   If you want to know more information, you can refer to the following link:
   [Convert to CentOS Stream 8](https://www.centos.org/news-and-events/convert-to-stream-8/)

   After switching to Steam 8, execute the following command to install:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_centos.sh && chmod +x lev_installation_for_centos.sh && source ./lev_installation_for_centos.sh
   ```

  ##### Ubuntu 14.04 / 16.04 / 18.04 / 20.04 / 22.04:
   
   Copy the following command and run it directly.
   
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh && chmod +x lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh && source ./lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh
   ```
 ##### Debian 8 / 9 / 10 / 11:  
   
   Copy the following command and run it directly.
  
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh && chmod +x lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh && source ./lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh

   ```
  
#### Option 2ï¼šStep-by-step installation

##### Install openssl
According to PEP 644, python 3.10 needs the support of openssl 1.1.1 and above, so systems with lower openssl versions need to compile a new openssl environment separately.

> Execute the command `openssl version` to view the version of openssl.

The installation process of openssl will be different in different systems. For details, please refer to the followings:

[Installation file for Debian/Ubuntu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh)

[Installation file for CentOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_centos.sh)

##### Install Python3.10 

The main language for writing and uploading your cybersecurity tools and workflows to Leviathan is Python3. More specifically, python 3.10+ is needed.

> For example, Ubuntu20.04 uses python3.8 by default, and so it needs to be upgraded.

> Linux users should upgrade the python version carefully. Do not use PPA source to install python3.10. You need to manually compile the source code for installation, otherwise it will affect the operation of internal programs, such as debian series apt tool.

The installation process of python 3.10 will be different in different systems. For details, please refer to the followings:

[Installation file for Debian/Ubuntu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh)

[Installation file for CentOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_centos.sh)

Enter `python3.10` in the terminal, and entering the execution environment of Python 3.10.4 means successful.

> (optional) configure the pip source to improve the speed of domestic pip use:

   ```bash
   # Enter the following commands into ~/.pip/pip.conf
   [global]
   index-url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/
   [install]
   trusted-host = pypi.douban.com
   ```
   
#####  Intsall PDM

PDM is a modern Python package manager 

> pdm supports [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/)ã€‚
>
> Extension file: [What is PDM?](https://pdm.fming.dev/)
>
> PDM official website: [https://pdm.fming.dev/](https://pdm.fming.dev/)

Excute the following command to install pdm:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdm-project/pdm/main/install-pdm.py | python3.10 -
```

> After PDM installation, you need to add the path of pdm to the system environment variable:
> `export PATH=$PATH:ç”¨æˆ·ä¸»ç›®å½•/.local/bin`
> **You can temporarily add the environment variable by executing this command in the terminal, then the reboot will disappear.**ï¼ŒYou can add this command to /etc/profile, or `.bashrc` , `.zshrc` file.

### 4.	Installation result test
   Once PDM is installed, you can verify whether the PDM tool has been installed successfully as follows.
   * Run

     ```bash
     $ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
     ```

     After the execution is completed, return to terminal:

     ```bash
     âœ” Installation succeeds.
     ```

    It means that the installation is successful. If other abnormal situations occur, please check whether the operation is performed correctly according to the previous step.

   * Next perform the second verification step:

     ```bash
     $ mkdir tmp #Create temp folder
     $ cd tmp #Go to temp folder
     $ pdm lev new test.demo #Create a test project
     ```

     After the test project is created, it will be prompted to output:

     ```shell
     Using Python interpreter: /usr/local/bin/python3.10 (3.10)
     Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
     ```

     At this point, it means that the test project has been created successfully.

   * Third verification step:
   
     ```bash
     $ cd test.demo
     $ pdm add levrt
     ```

     If the terminal outputs the followings, it indicates success.

     ```shell
     Adding packages to default dependencies: levrt
     âœ” ðŸ”’ Lock successful
     Changes are written to pdm.lock.
     Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
     Synchronizing working set with lock file: 17 to add, 0 to update, 0 to remove
      
       âœ” Install aiofiles 0.8.0 successful
       âœ” Install anyio 3.5.0 successful
       âœ” Install certifi 2021.10.8 successful
       âœ” Install charset-normalizer 2.0.12 successful
       âœ” Install idna 3.3 successful
       âœ” Install httpcore 0.14.7 successful
       âœ” Install h11 0.12.0 successful
       âœ” Install httpx 0.22.0 successful
       âœ” Install levrt 1.3.2 successful
       âœ” Install motor 2.5.1 successful
       âœ” Install mpmath 1.2.1 successful
       âœ” Install msgpack 1.0.3 successful
       âœ” Install nats-py 2.0.0 successful
       âœ” Install pymongo 3.12.3 successful
       âœ” Install rfc3986 2.0.0 successful
       âœ” Install sniffio 1.2.0 successful
       âœ” Install sympy 1.10.1 successful
     Installing the project as an editable package...
       âœ” Install lev.test.demo 0.1.0 successful
      
     ðŸŽ‰ All complete!
     ```

     Otherwise, the installation is not successful, please check whether you have followed the previous prompts.

     After the test is successful, you can delete the  `test.demo` folder.

    The next step is to enable the pep582 proposal globally. As a result, when the pdm command is executed in the shell, you can press the tab key and the system will promptis automatically.  
   Next, you need to configure pep582 environment variables in a way that fits your own operation system. The following commands are only examples:
  

   ###### Bashï¼š

   ```bash
   $ pdm --pep582 >> ~/.bashrc  # Add the pdm configuration to the end of the .bash_profile file
   $ pdm completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/pdm.bash-completion
   $ pdm config install.cache  True
   ```

   ###### Zshï¼š

   ```shell
   $ pdm --pep582 >> /etc/zsh/zprofile # Add the pdm configuration to the end of the .zprofile file
   $ pdm config install.cache True
   ```

   ###### Oh-My-Zshï¼š

   ```shell
   $ pdm --pep582 >> /etc/zsh/zprofile # Add the pdm configuration to the end of the .zprofile file
   $ mkdir $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/pdm
   $ pdm completion zsh > $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/pdm/_pdm
   # Then make sure pdm plugin is enabled in ~/.zshrc
   $ pdm config install.cache True
   ```

   Note: Under the `ï½ž/.zshrc` , there is a line `plugins=(git)` , modified to  `plugins=(git pdm)`.

   ###### Fishï¼š

   ```shell
   $ pdm --pep582 >> ~/.fprofile # or in /etc/
   $ pdm completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/pdm.fish
   $ pdm config feature.install.cache True
   ```

6. ###### Next, configure IDE. Here are two setting methods that enable the IDE to support PDM; PyCharm, VSCode, VSCode is recommended.

   ###### IDE General Settings

   ```bash
   #There is no built-in support or plugins for PEP 582 in most IDEs generally, you have to configure your tools manually.
   #PDM will write the storage project-wide configuration in .pdm.toml, so it is recommended that you add the following line to .gitignore:
   .pdm.toml
   __pypackages__/
   ```

   ###### PyCharm settings

   ```bash
   #Mark __pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib as Sources Root.
   
   #Also, if you want to use tools from the environment (such as pytest), you must add the __pypackages__/<major.minor>/bin directory to the PATH variable of the corresponding run or debug configuration. 
   ```

   ###### VSCode settings

   ```bash
   #Add the following two columns to the top-level dictionary .vscode/settings.json of settings, which can be opened by selecting Edit in settings.json in the vscode interface settings:
   {
     "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"],
     "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"]
   }
   ```

   Note: The `<major.minor>` of the compiler's PDM settings should be the version number of your computer's Python3 when adding the configuration, such as`__pypackages__/3.10/lib`. 


### 5. Introduction of pdm-lev

pdm-lev is a pdm component provided by the official Leviathan, which provides comprehensive support for the development. 

pdm-lev does not provide an upgrade method for the time being, you need to upgrade manually:
```bash
$ pdm plugin remove pdm-lev
$ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
```
### 6. QA

If you encounter the following errors while developing:

> `  No module named 'pdm' `
>
> `  No module named 'levrt' `

The highly probable cause may be that your python environment dependencies are abnormal. Please make sure the execution environment is the same as the python environment bound to pdm.

At this point, the environment configuration is completed, start the [next step](https://github.com/talentsec/lev_doc/blob/main/4.%20%E5%87%AD%E8%AF%81%E4%B8%8A%E4%BC%A0%E4%B8%8E%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96-en.md)
