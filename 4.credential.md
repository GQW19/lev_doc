## Credential uploading and acquisition

The credentials required to access all the functions of Leviathan are as follows. Please read the following contents carefully to obtain and upload the required credentials as needed:
* Personal SSH public key
* Credentials for accessing Leviathan System SDK


### Personal SSH public key upload

Every developer on Leviathan needs to upload their SSH public key to Leviathan if they want to test their own tools and workflows locally, or to test the package uploaded by other users on Leviathan. The followings teach you how to obtain a personal SSH public key and upload it to Leviathan.

1. Check if a local public key file exists:

   Linux：

   ```bash
   cd ~/.ssh
   ls -la
   #If there is a .pub file (such as id_rsa.pub), there is no need to generate the SSH public key again.
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   Windows:

   ```powershell
   cd ~\.ssh	#username is the current Windows user name, please refer to Leviathan Documentation.
   dir
   #If there is a .pub file (such as id_rsa.pub), you do not need to make the SSH public key again.
   type ~\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
   ```

   An SSH key pair needs to be generated:

   Linux:

   ```bash
   $ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -C "youremail@example.com"
   # It is not recommended to use the rsa encryption algorithm to generate a key pair, ecdsa is more secure and is supported by the new version of OpenSSL.
   ```

   Windows：

   ```powershell
   $ ssh-keygen.exe # enter until the end
   ```



3. Log in to Leviathan, in `Account Settings` - `Public Key Management`, select Upload SSH Public Key, copy and add the `id_rsa.pub` public key file generated in the above steps.



### SDK Credential Acquisition

If developers want to be able to write their own tools and workflows, or upload their own packages, they need to access Leviathan system SDK credentials. Leviathan system SDK credentials are used for uploading package authentication, and are associated with the image used by the calling tool, which is generated here. The token corresponds to the  **LEVHUB_KEY** in the tool call and workflow writing. 

Log in to Leviathan platform, and in `Account Settings` - `Developer Settings`, select Generate token. **Please note that this token will only be displayed once, so record it locally**.
