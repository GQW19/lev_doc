## Credential uploading and acquisition

For developers, you need to upload a public key and generate a token for identity authentication. Please read the following carefully:

* Upload SSH public key
* Generate Token


### Upload SSH public key

As developers of the leviathan open source community, one need to upload SSH public key to the platform for user identity authentication. The following are the steps to generate the SSH public key and upload it to the platform.

1. Check if a local public key file exists:

   Mac/Linux：

   ```bash
   cd ~/.ssh
   ls -la
   # If there is a .pub file (such as id_rsa.pub), there is no need to generate the SSH public key again.
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   Windows:

   ```powershell
   cd ~\.ssh	# username is the current Windows user name, please refer to Leviathan Documentation.
   dir
   # If there is a .pub file (such as id_rsa.pub), you do not need to make the SSH public key again.
   type ~\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
   ```

2. Generating SSH key pair if not exists:

   Mac/Linux:

   ```bash
   $ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -C "youremail@example.com"
   # It is not recommended to use the rsa encryption algorithm to generate a key pair, ecdsa is more secure and is supported by the new version of OpenSSL.
   ```

   Windows：

   ```powershell
   $ ssh-keygen.exe # enter until the end
   ```



3. Log in to Leviathan, in `Account Setting` - `Public Key`, click `Create SSH public key`, copy and paste the content of `id_ed25519.pub` file generated in the above steps.



### Generate upload credentials

If developers want to publish toolkit package to the platform, one need to apply for an API Key.

1. Log in to the Leviathan platform, in `Account Settings` - `Developer Setting`, click `Generate token`, enter the name, then submit. **Please safekeeping your token, it cannot be retrieved if lost**。
2. You need to set the environment variable `LEVHUB_KEY` to the token applied in the first step when uploading the package.
```shell
# Example
export LEVHUB_KEY=BzkVKv749U6UwjjRWsjBrVm4Y3ap6tpT4aT0WKfgcqTRG2PjT74djhaQV9AMDvjqQro25GgJ
# Upload
pdm lev upload
```
