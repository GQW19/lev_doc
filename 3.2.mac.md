## Mac

> Remark: The underlying technical solution implemented by Docker Desktop under Mac is based on virtual machine technology, and the nat network mode is used by default. Because of this, there might be unexpected behaviors in some scenarios when using tools such as Nmap for LAN scanning.

### 1. Install Docker 

If Docker is installed on your device, make sure its version number ≥ **20.10.10**。

> The agent operating environment requirements of Leviathan:
>
> Decker Desktop version number ≥ 20.10.10

Go to the download page of [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) , and find the Docker that matches your computer's operating system to download and install.

Start Docker after the installation is completed. When the Docker Logo on the lower left corner is green, it means you have successfully launched Docker!

### 2. Install Python3.10

Download the PKG installation package of python3.10 from the official website and click Install.

Since the Mac has its own python environment, after installing python3.10, you need to enter the command 'python3.10' to start it.

> Optional configuration：
>
> After python3 is installed, you can use the following command to configure the pip source
>
>```bash
>$ cd ~
>$ mkdir .pip
>$ vim .pip/pip.conf
>```
>
>Copy and paste the following into the pip.conf file:
>
>```toml
>[global]
>index-url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/>simple/
>[install]
>trusted-host=pypi.douban.com
>```

### 3. Install PDM

PDM is a modern Python package manager that supports [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/). It is similar to npm, installing and managing packages in a way that doesn't require creating a virtualenv. 

Leviathan use PDM for testing, publishing and dependency management.

> [Whata is PDM？](https://pdm.fming.dev/)

**Recommended installation method**

Install using homebrew：

```bash
brew install pdm
```

> brew will directly download the dependencies required by pdm: python3.10 and other dependent packages. Unlike the python3.10 manually installed above, the python3.10 downloaded by brew will only be stored in pdm's own folder.

**Manual installation**

Use the script provided by the official website to specify the version to install:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdm-project/pdm/main/install-pdm.py | python3.10 - -v 1.13.4
```

> pdm is now in a rapid iterative process, and some versions may have some problems, so you need to specify the version to install.

### 4. Install pdm-lev plugin

pdm-lev is a pdm plugin provided by Leviathan, which is used for project construction, development, testing and management, and can automatically generate the Leviathan project framework.

Install using the following command:

```bash
pdm plugin add pdm-lev
```

After the execution is completed, the terminal returns

```bash
✔ Installation succeeds.
```

It means the installation is successful.

> The latest version of pdm-lev is 1.2.6, and the installed version can be judged by the following command:
>
> ```bash
> pdm plugin list
> ```
>
> If it is found that the version of pdm-lev is too low, it is most likely caused by the source not being synchronized in time. Just switch the source of python and reinstall it.

> pdm-lev does not provide an automatic upgrade method for the time being. You can use the following commands to upgrade manually:
>
> ```bash
> $ pdm plugin remove pdm-lev
> $ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
> ```

### 5. IDE configuration

In order for the IDE to work, we first have to enable the `pep582` proposal globally.

> Q：What is pep582 proposal?（refer to the link [pep582](https://peps.python.org/pep-0582/)）
>
> A：The pep582 configuration allows the python interpreter to automatically look for `__pypackages__` in the current working directory and its parent directories. That is, if you don't want to add a pdm run every time you execute a command, you can directly set the variable to the current environment, you only need to use the shell program in pdm --pep582 to enable pep582

Use the following command in `powershell` to add `pep582` to the system environment variables:

```bash
pdm --pep582 >> ~/[your profile name]
source ~/[your profile name]

# example: pdm --pep582 >> ~/.zsh
```

Next configure the IDE to enable the IDE to support PDM:

#### VSCode settings
```bash
# Add the following two items to the top-level dictionary in .vscode/settings.json:
{
  "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"],
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"]
}
```

> Note: The `<major.minor>` above is the version number of python, such as `__pypackages__/3.10/lib` .
