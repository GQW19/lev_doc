## Local testing

### Add executable file

1. (Package) In the path of `./lev-hub/username.tool`, add the executable file `main.py`,

   Here, take the testing of nmap_python as an example.Add the executable file `main.py` under `./lev-hub/szczecin.nmap_python/`:
   

```python
from lev.szczecin.nmap_python import nmap

# levrt.run can only execute asynchronous functions, so when testing, the target method needs to be encapsulated by an asynchronous function first.
async def test_alive(ip: str):
    result = await nmap.alive(ip)
    data =  await result.get()
    print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import levrt
    # log related code
    # logger related commands can enable the compiler command line to output debugging data when the tool is executed
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig()
    logger = logging.getLogger("lev")
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    
    # Note that in order for subprocess to execute the command correctly, the parameter values passed into the workflow must conform to the type defined by the parameter.
    levrt.run(test_alive("192.168.1.1/24"))
```

2. "(workflow package) Add the executable file `main.py`  in the path `./lev-hub/username.asset`.
Here take the test server as an example. Add the executable file `main.py` under `./lev-hub/szczecin.nmap_python/`:


```python
from lev.szczecin.nmap_python import asset
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import levrt
    # import logging

    # logger = logging.getLogger("lev")
    # logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    # Logger related commands can enable the compiler command line to output debugging data when the tool is executed.
    # The workflow code itself is an asynchronous function, so no additional packaging is required.
    levrt.run(asset.alive_nmap_python('192.168.1.1/24'))
    
```

### Run

Execute the command in the current directory:

```shell
$ pdm run python main.py
```



### Troubleshoot the cause of failure

There are many reasons why you may encounter failures during the testing process. Here are some common ones:

1. Connect call failed ('127.0.0.1', 38379)

   Because of the defects of docker itself, the containers cannot access each other after the computer sleeps, the docker service needs to be restarted.
   It may also cause the following devices to go offline.

2. Device offline

   The agent cannot connect to the server. You need to execute the `ssh lev agent | sudo docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker --rm -i talentsec/lev` command to re-pull and execute the agent.

### SSH configuration

If you have performed this step before, you can skip.

1. Enter the file directory where the ssh public key is stored, create a new config file, and write the following configuration:

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
vim config

Host lev
    HostName service.lev.zone
    Port 2222
    User username	# replace with the username of your Leviathan name here



### Launch talentsec/lev

1. Log in to Leviathan, obtain talentsec/lev in `Account Settings` - `My Device`
Execute the startup command on the local command line to set up a local database environment, a container calling environment, and a remote link with Leviathan system[^9](#What configurations are enabled for talentsec/lev?):

```bash
ssh lev agent | docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker --rm -i talentsec/lev
```

2. After the containers are all started, you can execute the run command under `./lev-hub/username.tool` to use the tool:

```bash
pdm run python main.py
```
