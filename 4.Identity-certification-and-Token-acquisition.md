## Identity certification and Token acquisition

### Upload SSH public key

Developers on Leviathan need to upload their SSH public key to Leviathan for user identity certification.

If you already have an SSH public key, you can use the following command to get the public key information:

> Mac/Linux：
>
> ```bash
> cd ~/.ssh
> ls -la
> cat ~/.ssh/[pubkey file].pub
> ```
>
> Windows:
>
> ```bash
> cd ~\.ssh
> dir
> type ~\.ssh\[pubkey file].pub
> ```

If you don't have your own public key, you can generate it with the following command:

> Mac/Linux:
>
> ```bash
> $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "youremail@example.com"
> ```
>
> Windows：
>
> ```powershell
> $ ssh-keygen.exe -t ed25519
> ```
>
> Note: It is not recommended to use the default rsa encryption algorithm to generate a key pair, ed25519 is more secure and is supported by the new version of OpenSSL. Rsa is disabled by default in OpenSSH8.8 and above.

Log in to Leviathan, in `Account Settings` - `Public Key Management`, select `Create SSH Public Key`, copy and submit the content of the public key file.

### Apply for Namespace

`Namespace` is the place which stores all the tools you will create in the future. It is used to manage tools and packages. You can apply for your own `namespace` according to the following process:

> It is recommended to use **your username of Leviathan** to name your own namespace

After logging in to Leviathan, select `Repository` - `Namespace` - `Create Namespace`, and then enter the name of the namespace you want to create.

### Generate API Token

Log in to Leviathan,  and in `Account Settings` - `Developer Settings`, select `Generate token`. Enter the name, select the validity period, and specify the namespace. The namespace can be empty (meaning that all namespaces are authorized).

> <font color="red">Please keep your token properly, it cannot be retrieved if lost.</font>

When uploading the package, you need to set the environment variable `LEVHUB_TOKEN` to the token you have applied before, you can use the following command

```shell
export LEVHUB_TOKEN=BzkxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxGgJ
```
