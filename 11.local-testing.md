## Local testing

### Add executable file

1. At the root level of the project, add the executable file `main.py`,

   Here, take the testing of nmap_python as an example. Add the executable file `main.py` under `./lev-hub/szczecin.nmap_python/`:
   

```python
from lev.szczecin.nmap_python import nmap

# levrt.run can only execute asynchronous functions, so when testing, the target method needs to be encapsulated by an asynchronous function first.
async def test_alive(ip: str):
    result = await nmap.alive(ip)
    data =  await result.get()
    print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import levrt
    # log related code
    # logger related commands can enable the compiler command line to output debugging data when the tool is executed
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig()
    logger = logging.getLogger("lev")
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
  
    levrt.run(test_alive("192.168.1.1/24"))
```

### Run

Execute the command in the current directory:

```bash
$ pdm run python main.py
```

### Debugging locally

#### python code debugging

If you want to debug during the local testing, you can use levrt.run() to execute your modes and workflows locally, then use pdb for breakpoint debugging locally.

You need to import pdb under the remote method. If you import it externally, you will be prompted that the module cannot be found.

```python
def raw(argv:list[str]) -> Cr:
    @remote
    def entry(argv):
        import pdb
```

#### View the running results
##### Container log
待完善
##### Result file
If you want to view the files inside the container, use the command `docker cp` instead of directly using `docker start` to start the container.
Restarting the container will cause the task to be re-executed, which will affect the last output.

### Troubleshoot the cause of failure

There are many reasons why you may encounter failures during the testing process. Here are some common ones:

1. Connect call failed ('127.0.0.1', 38379)

   Because of the defects of docker itself, the containers cannot access each other after the computer sleeps, and the docker service needs to be restarted.
   It may also cause the following devices to go offline.

2. Device offline

   The agent cannot connect to the server. You need to execute the `ssh lev agent | sudo docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker --rm -i talentsec/lev` command to re-pull and execute the agent.
