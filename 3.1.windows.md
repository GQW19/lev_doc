### Windows

Docker under Windows is implemented by the [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/) virtualization technology with [NAT](https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/what-is-network-address-translation) mode as the default. Because of this, there might be unexpected behaviors in some scenarios when using tools such as Nmap for LAN scanning. Therefore, this tutorial recommends using the `virtual machine + Linux` , which is more stable.

#### 1. Install Docker

##### 1.1 Docker environment configuration

 Pre-knowledge: [what is docker](https://www.redhat.com/zh/topics/containers/what-is-docker)

 If Docker is installed on your device, please check its version number. Leviathan supports 20.10.10 and above. If this condition is met, you can skip this step, otherwise, please install or update Docker as follows.
 
 Docker installation on Windows is complicated. First, you need to enable the built-in 'Hyper-V' function on Windows (therefore, it is recommended to use Linux system or WSL instead of Windows). The following tutorial takes Win10 as an example and explains differences when using different Win10 system edition (If you don't know your system edition, feel free to google it).



##### 1.2 Enable CPU virtualization support

 Enter the BIOS settings in system and check whether the BIOS has enabled CPU virtualization support as below.

##### 1.3 Win10 Home Edition Pre-step

It is strongly recommended to upgrade to Win10 Professional version or use Linux, Mac. If you use Win10 Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition or Education Edition, please skip this step and enter 1.4.

First, you need to enable the Hyper-V module. The Windows Home Edition cannot query the 'Hyper-V' function module. It needs to be enabled in a special way as follows:

Update the operating system to the latest version, Windows Settings -> Update -> Check for updates

Enable the display of file extensions. For details [refer to File Extension Display](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/f7ff0bfcc9c0e12e26bb13a0.html)

Copy the following code into a new document:


```
pushd "%~dp0"
dir /b %SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\*Hyper-V*.mum >hyper-v.txt
for /f %%i in ('findstr /i . hyper-v.txt 2^>nul') do dism /online /norestart /add-package:"%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\%%i"
del hyper-v.txt
Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All /LimitAccess /ALL
```

 Save the document as install-hyper-v.cmd, right click and run as administrator.

![install hyper-v.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/61620bb6-2a0d-4974-a27c-39471f7c0020.png)



 After the installation is completed, enter Y and restart. (Note: **If the system is updated after the installation is completed, it may cause the installation to be invalid, you need to check, and if necessary, reinstall hyper-v**)


 Repeat the above steps, save the following code as change.cmd and run as administrator.

 `REG ADD "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion" /v EditionId /T REG_EXPAND_SZ /d Professional /F`

 Now, the Win10 Home Edition Hyper-V should be enabled.



##### 1.4 Win10 Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition, Education Edition

 If you use Win10 Professional Edition, Education Edition, or Enterprise Edition, it won't be as complicated as the Home Edition. Go to Control Panel -> Programs -> Enable or Disable Windows functions -> Check hyper-v, and then follow the prompts to restart the system.

 The following steps should and must be performed on all Windows systems.


 Enable the display of file extensions. For details, refer to [File Extension Display](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/f7ff0bfcc9c0e12e26bb13a0.html)

 Download the docker installation file. [docker installer download](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker Desktop Installer.exe?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=dd-smartbutton&utm_location=header)

 Click the file to install docker (the Home Edition requires that Windows Container WSL2 should be unchecked during the installation; This step is not needed in other Win Editions).

 Wait for the installation to restart successfully. After restarting, open Docker Desktop by clicking the icon. Docker has a graphical interface under **Windows**.

 When the Docker Logo on the lower left corner is green, it means you have successfully launched Docker![image.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/87fe783c-f999-4b50-85f9-99a0080d6561.png)

 If it displays that docker fails to launch and reports the error **"Hyper-V component is not running"**, it means that hardware virtualization has not been started. Please perform the first step: **1.2 to enable CPU virtualization support**.


#### 2. Install Python 3.10

It is very simple and convenient to install python on Windows. Download the latest version of the python installation package (version > 3.10 is required) from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), click INSTALL, and restart after the installation is completed. You need to confirm whether python has successfully added environment variables in cmd or powershell.

After python3 is installed, please configure the pip source of Tsinghua University, otherwise it will be very slow when installing python dependencies.


#### 3. Install PDM 

After the installation of python3.10 in the previous step, start to install the PDM tool.

PDM is a modern Python package manager that supports [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/). It is similar to npm, installing and managing packages in a way that doesn't require creating a virtualenv. Leviathan use PDM for testing, publishing and dependency management. The following will describe how to install and configure PDM.[What is PDMï¼Ÿ](https://pdm.fming.dev/)

PDM officially provides the installation script under Windows:`(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdm-project/pdm/main/install-pdm.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -`

It can be executed directly in cmd or powershell. It is recommended to use the pip source of Tsinghua University. You need to complete some configuration of PDM after installation.

1. Once PDM is installed, you can verify whether the PDM tool has been installed successfully as follows.

   * Execute command in powershell

      ```bash
      $ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
      ```

     After the execution is completed, the terminal returns:

     ```bash
     âœ” Installation succeeds.
     ```

     It means that the installation is successful. If other abnormal situations occur, please check whether the operation has been performed correctly according to the previous step.

   * Next, perform the second verification step:

     ```bash
     $ mkdir tmp # Create temp folder
     $ cd tmp # Go to temp folder
     $ pdm lev new test.demo # Create a test project
     ```

     After the test project is created, a prompt output will appear:

     ```shell
     Using Python interpreter: /usr/local/bin/python3.10 (3.10)
     Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
     ```

     At this point, it means that the "test" project has been created successfully.

   * The third verification step:

     ```bash
     $ cd test.demo
     $ pdm add levrt
     ```

     If the terminal outputs the followings, it means the installation is successful:

     ```shell
     Adding packages to default dependencies: levrt
     âœ” ðŸ”’ Lock successful
     Changes are written to pdm.lock.
     Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
     Synchronizing working set with lock file: 17 to add, 0 to update, 0 to remove
      
       âœ” Install aiofiles 0.8.0 successful
       âœ” Install anyio 3.5.0 successful
       âœ” Install certifi 2021.10.8 successful
       âœ” Install charset-normalizer 2.0.12 successful
       âœ” Install idna 3.3 successful
       âœ” Install httpcore 0.14.7 successful
       âœ” Install h11 0.12.0 successful
       âœ” Install httpx 0.22.0 successful
       âœ” Install levrt 1.3.2 successful
       âœ” Install motor 2.5.1 successful
       âœ” Install mpmath 1.2.1 successful
       âœ” Install msgpack 1.0.3 successful
       âœ” Install nats-py 2.0.0 successful
       âœ” Install pymongo 3.12.3 successful
       âœ” Install rfc3986 2.0.0 successful
       âœ” Install sniffio 1.2.0 successful
       âœ” Install sympy 1.10.1 successful
     Installing the project as an editable package...
       âœ” Install lev.test.demo 0.1.0 successful
      
     ðŸŽ‰ All complete!
     ```

     Otherwise, the installation is not successful. Please check whether you have followed the previous prompts.

     After the test is successful, you can delete the `test.demo` folder.
     
2. After PDM is installed, you need to configure the pep582 environment variable mode. Enable pep582 globally (from the pdm official website):

   ```powershell
   # powershell
   $ mkdir $PROFILE\..\Completions
   $ echo @'
   Get-ChildItem "$PROFILE\..\Completions\" | ForEach-Object {
       . $_.FullName
   }
   '@ | Out-File -Append -Encoding utf8 $PROFILE
   # Generate script
   $ Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
   $ pdm completion powershell | Out-File -Encoding utf8 $PROFILE\..\Completions\pdm_completion.ps1

   ```

3. Next, configure the IDE to support PDM. PyCharm and VSCode will be illustrated, VSCode is recommended.

   ###### IDE General Settings
   Now there are not built-in support or plugins for PEP 582 in most IDEs, you have to configure your tools manually.

    PDM will write and store project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml and you are recommended to add following lines in the .gitignore:
   ```bash
   .pdm.toml
   __pypackages__/
   ```

   ###### PyCharm Settings
   Mark `__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib` as Sources Root. Then, select as Python interpreter a Python installation with the same `<major.minor>` version.

   Additionally, if you want to use tools from the environment (e.g. `pytest`), you have to add the `__pypackages__/<major.minor>/bin` directory to the PATH variable in the corresponding run/debug configuration.

   ###### VSCode settings
   Add the following two entries to the top-level dict in `.vscode/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"],
     "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"]
   }
   ```

   Note: When you add `<major.minor>` to the configuration, it should be replaced by your Python3 version, such as `__pypackages__/3.10/lib`. 

#### 4. Python environment dependencies

If you encounter errors such as: `  No module named 'pdm' ` ,`  No module named 'levrt' `, etc. in the next steps, it is mostly like due to abnormal python environment dependencies.

If you installed pdm through pip, you need to use the python interpreter bundled with pip to execute the specific code.



#### 5. Introduction of the pdm-lev plugin

pdm-lev is a pdm plugin provided by Leviathan, which can help you automatically generate projects that meet the requirements of Leviathan. It will greatly improve your efficiency.

pdm-lev does not provide an upgrade method for the time being, and you need to upgrade manually.

```bash
$ pdm plugin remove pdm-lev
$ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
```



   At this point, the environment configuration is completed! Let's start the [next step](https://github.com/talentsec/lev_doc/blob/main/4.%20%E5%87%AD%E8%AF%81%E4%B8%8A%E4%BC%A0%E4%B8%8E%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96-en.md).
