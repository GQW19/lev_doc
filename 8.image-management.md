## Image management

### Containerize tools

Docker, similar to virtual machines but much lighter and simpler than virtual machines, is a container technology that can isolate applications from the system environment.

You can directly pull the nmap image packaged and published by others in dockerhub, or you can package nmap on your own to create your own unique tool image:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nmap/nmap.git
```

```dockerfile
FROM python:alpine

WORKDIR /root/
# Modify the source of pip in docker
RUN pip install -U pip
RUN pip config set global.index-url http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple
RUN pip config set install.trusted-host mirrors.aliyun.com
# Modify the source of the apk add command in docker
RUN sed -i 's/dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/mirrors.aliyun.com/g' /etc/apk/repositories
# Add nmap tool and pip to install bs4 dependencies, bs4 dependencies can be replaced with any python dependencies you need to add, otherwise you don't need to add them.
RUN apk add nmap && pip install bs4

ENTRYPOINT ["nmap"] 
```

### Create github repo
Log in to GitHub -> click the + sign in the upper right corner -> click new repository to create a code repository, or choose an old code repository.

### Upload & Build Image
#### Create a new image
In the repository you created in the previous step, upload a Dockerfile file. You can use the Dockerfile content in `5. Build the security tool nmap`.

#### Build image

Image management is an automatic image construction service provided by Leviathan. As a developer, you only need to bind your Github account with Leviathan, and then you can automatically build the required image with the Dockerfile under any repository of your Github. We recommend this instead of using the image that has been built by a third-party platform[^1](#Why is it more recommended to build images on Leviathan?). The following are the steps related to the automatic construction of the image.

1. Log in to Leviathan platform, and in `Account Settings` -> `Developer Settings`, choose to bind a Github account to authorize Leviathan to access your Github repository.

2. Supposing the repository created in the previous step is named "CHAOXI", take "CHAOXI" as an example.

3. Log in to Leviathan platform. In `Warehouse` - `Image Management`, select `Add Image`, fill in the name of the tool you need to upload or test, and then select the "CHAOXI" warehouse to complete.

  (If you set the image to be public when adding the image, other users will be able to see the code repository of the building tool image. Once successfully built and reviewed, the image will also be made public and can be invoked directly by other Leviathan users.)![image management example.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/37c665bb-b577-476e-a202-92f8a5b9fa7e.png)

4. After adding, click the image name to enter the details page![image rule example.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/0f145a9f-84ab-42ad-a0c2-2a8733c5bcd8.png)

5. Add the rule of image building, select the Dockerfile path of a different branch, and fill it in.

6. When the rules of image building are added, you can choose to build the image immediately -> wait for the image to be built -> join the audit queue

   After tool review, if you want to give the tool to other users, please remember to disclose the image used by the tool on the image management page.

When building a tool image, Leviathan will review the image. After the review, the image can be invoked by the code with the name of `.username.tool`. In our example, it is `.szczecin.namp`, and the following is an example of adding an image:

```bash
Please select a warehouse
name:
tool
description:

Remark:

set True/False to be public #After setting public, other users will be able to see the code repository of the build tool image

Type: Branch

Dockerfile path: Dockerfile

```



### Dockerfile example

```dockerfile
# nmap in a container:
# [ docker run -it --rm networkstatic/nmap --help ]
# Scan for open ssh (tcp/22) ports on a range of IPs
# [ docker run -it --rm networkstatic/nmap -sT 192.168.1.1-100 -p 22 ]
FROM python:3.10-alpine3.14 # Inherited from an image, usually this image contains the tools needed for this project, such as python, note: Dockerfile has and can only inherit one image.

# Each RUN instruction will execute the specified command based on the current image and submit it as a new image. Use \ to wrap a line when the command is long.
RUN apk update && apk add \

# The command is to be executed after the configuration container is started, and cannot be overridden by the parameters provided by docker run.
# There can only be one ENTRYPOINT in each Dockerfile, when multiple ENTRYPOINTs are specified, only the last one takes effect.
# Execution point, can be overridden by entry() method injection in python code
