###  Linux (take ubuntu 20.04 as an example)
#### 1. Install Docker

When you are developing cybersecurity tools on Leviathan, the tools need to be built as tool image first. Likewise, when you are trying to use the tools on Leviathan, the image containers of the corresponding tools should be launched as well. These steps all require Docker to provide the image and container environment. The installation of Docker is described below. 

1. Find the Linux version of the docker installation tutorial on the official Docker download page and operate step by step:[installation tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/);
2. When using the tools and workflows on Leviathan and testing tool availability, you need to launch Docker firstly;
3. Please confirm that the version of Docker Engine you installed is 20.10.10 or higher. 



#### 2. Install Python3.10 

The main language for writing and uploading your cybersecurity tools and workflows to Leviathan is Python3. More specifically, python 3.10+ is needed to support the pdm plugin. The installation of Python3.10 will be introduced below.ï¼ˆ**Take ubuntu20.04 as an example**ï¼‰

Ubuntu20.04 uses python3.8 by default, and so it needs to be upgraded.

Linux users should upgrade the python version carefully. Do not use PPA source to install python3.10. You need to manually compile the source code for installation, otherwise it will affect the operation of internal programs, such as debian series apt tool.

1. Download the 3.10 source code package, unzip it to the folder's [download address](https://www.python.org/downloads)

2. In the process of downloading the file package, you can pre-install the libraries and tools required for compilation. Prerequisite tools and libraries may differ for different Linux distributions, please check based on the package name: libssl , libffi.

   ```bash
   $ sudo apt install libssl-dev cmake libffi-dev
   ```

3.  [Download the zlib library](http://www.zlib.net/)ï¼Œunzip, compile and install it

   ```shell
   cd zlib-1.2.11
   ./configure
   make test
   sudo make install
   ```

4. After the zlib library is installed, enter python3.10 source code folder to install it. Please note that if the libraries and tools in step 2 are not installed, abnormal errors may occur.

   ```bash
   cd python3.10
   ./configure
   make test
   sudo make install
   ```

5. Once the compilation is complete, enter `python3.10` in the terminal, and execute it in a new line. Entering the execution environment of Python means successful.

6. After python3 is installed, please configure the pip source of Tsinghua University:

   ```bash
   $ cd ~
   $ mkdir .pip
   $ vim .pip/pip.conf
   ```

   Then copy and paste the following text and save it:

   ```toml
   [global]
   index-url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/
   [install]
   trusted-host=pypi.douban.com
   ```

   

5. At this point, python3.10 is installed, and the latest pip and setuptools tools are also installed. Now it's ready for the following PDM installation.


#### 3. Intsall PDM

PDM is a modern Python package manager that supports [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/)ã€‚PDM is a modern Python package manager that supports PEP 582. It installs and manages packages in a manner similar to npm, in that there is no need to create a virtualenv at all. Leviathan uses PDM to temporarily manage the unpublished packages of tools and workflows locally, and also uses PDM to conduct usability testing of local tools and workflows. To upload tools and workflows in the community also requires the support of PDM. PDM will be introduced below. The installation is related to the user's local configuration. [What is PDM?](https://pdm.fming.dev/)
How to install PDM and configure it locally will be introduced below.

1. Enter the PDM official website: [https://pdm.fming.dev/](https://pdm.fming.dev/)

2. Under the `Installtion` item, you will find the command that matches your computer's operating system version for installation. PDM supports source code installation and third-party installer installation (refer to the official documentation):

   Firstly, install pipx with pip: 	`pip3 install --user pipx`(you need to specify the pip bundled with the python3.10 version, not the system build-in pip )

   Then install PDM with pipx: 	`pipx install pdm`

   **Note**: After pip installs pipx, the command line may not be able to find the pipx command. You need to import the temporary environment variables so that the system can find the pipx command.

3. After PDM installation, you need to add the path of pdm to the system environment variable.`export PATH=$PATH:ç”¨æˆ·ä¸»ç›®å½•/.local/bin` ,**You can temporarily add the environment variable by executing this command in the terminal**ï¼Œ You can add this command to /etc/profile, or `.bashrc` , `.zshrc` fileï¼Œ**Note that if you add the command to /etc/profile and when the terminal is running zsh after rebooting, the content in /etc/profile will not be loaded.**

4. Once PDM is installed, you can verify whether the PDM tool has been installed successfully as follows.

   * Run

     ```bash
     $ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
     ```

     After the execution is completed, return to terminal:

     ```bash
     âœ” Installation succeeds.
     ```

    It means that the installation is successful. If other abnormal situations occur, please check whether the operation is performed correctly according to the previous step.

   * Next perform the second verification step:

     ```bash
     $ mkdir tmp #Create temp folder
     $ cd tmp #Go to temp folder
     $ pdm lev new test.demo #Create a test project
     ```

     After the test project is created, it will be prompted to output:

     ```shell
     Using Python interpreter: /usr/local/bin/python3.10 (3.10)
     Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
     ```

     At this point, it means that the test project has been created successfully.

   * Third verification step:
   
     ```bash
     $ cd test.demo
     $ pdm add levrt
     ```

     If the terminal outputs the followings, it indicates success.

     ```shell
     Adding packages to default dependencies: levrt
     âœ” ðŸ”’ Lock successful
     Changes are written to pdm.lock.
     Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
     Synchronizing working set with lock file: 17 to add, 0 to update, 0 to remove
      
       âœ” Install aiofiles 0.8.0 successful
       âœ” Install anyio 3.5.0 successful
       âœ” Install certifi 2021.10.8 successful
       âœ” Install charset-normalizer 2.0.12 successful
       âœ” Install idna 3.3 successful
       âœ” Install httpcore 0.14.7 successful
       âœ” Install h11 0.12.0 successful
       âœ” Install httpx 0.22.0 successful
       âœ” Install levrt 1.3.2 successful
       âœ” Install motor 2.5.1 successful
       âœ” Install mpmath 1.2.1 successful
       âœ” Install msgpack 1.0.3 successful
       âœ” Install nats-py 2.0.0 successful
       âœ” Install pymongo 3.12.3 successful
       âœ” Install rfc3986 2.0.0 successful
       âœ” Install sniffio 1.2.0 successful
       âœ” Install sympy 1.10.1 successful
     Installing the project as an editable package...
       âœ” Install lev.test.demo 0.1.0 successful
      
     ðŸŽ‰ All complete!
     ```

     Otherwise, the installation is not successful, please check whether you have followed the previous prompts.

     After the test is successful, you can delete the  `test.demo` folder.

5. The next step is to enable the pep582 proposal globally. As a result, when the pdm command is executed in the shell, you can press the tab key and the system will promptis automatically.  
   Next, you need to configure pep582 environment variables in a way that fits your own operation system. The following commands are only examples
  

   ###### Bashï¼š

   ```bash
   $ pdm --pep582 >> ~/.bashrc  # Add the pdm configuration to the end of the .bash_profile file
   $ pdm completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/pdm.bash-completion
   $ pdm config install.cache  True
   ```

   ###### Zshï¼š

   ```shell
   $ pdm --pep582 >> /etc/zsh/zprofile # Add the pdm configuration to the end of the .zprofile file
   $ pdm config install.cache True
   ```

   ###### Oh-My-Zshï¼š

   ```shell
   $ pdm --pep582 >> /etc/zsh/zprofile # Add the pdm configuration to the end of the .zprofile file
   $ mkdir $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/pdm
   $ pdm completion zsh > $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/pdm/_pdm
   # Then make sure pdm plugin is enabled in ~/.zshrc
   $ pdm config install.cache True
   ```

   Note: Under the `ï½ž/.zshrc` , there is a line `plugins=(git)` , modified to  `plugins=(git pdm)`.

   ###### Fishï¼š

   ```shell
   $ pdm --pep582 >> ~/.fprofile # or in /etc/
   $ pdm completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/pdm.fish
   $ pdm config feature.install.cache True
   ```

6. ###### Next, configure IDE. Here are two setting methods that enable the IDE to support PDM; PyCharm, VSCode, VSCode is recommended.

   ###### IDE General Settings

   ```bash
   #There is no built-in support or plugins for PEP 582 in most IDEs generally, you have to configure your tools manually.
   #PDM will write the storage project-wide configuration in .pdm.toml, so it is recommended that you add the following line to .gitignore:
   .pdm.toml
   __pypackages__/
   ```

   ###### PyCharm settings

   ```bash
   #Mark __pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib as Sources Root.
   
   #Also, if you want to use tools from the environment (such as pytest), you must add the __pypackages__/<major.minor>/bin directory to the PATH variable of the corresponding run or debug configuration. 
   ```

   ###### VSCode settings

   ```bash
   #Add the following two columns to the top-level dictionary .vscode/settings.json of settings, which can be opened by selecting Edit in settings.json in the vscode interface settings:
   {
     "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"],
     "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"]
   }
   ```

   æ³¨ï¼šNote: The `<major.minor>` of the compiler's PDM settings should be the version number of your computer's Python3 when adding the configuration, such as`__pypackages__/3.10/lib`. 

#### 4. python environment dependencies

You may encounter various errors in the next steps, such as: `  No module named 'pdm' ` ,`  No module named 'levrt' ` when running the code.The highly probable cause may be that your python environment dependencies are abnormal.

If you installed pdm through pip, you need to ensure that you use the python interpreter bundled with pip to execute the specific code, or the python interpreter selected after the `pdm init` command to execute.


#### 5. Introduction of the pdm-lev plugin-in

pdm-lev is a pdm plug-in provided by the official Leviathan, which can help you automatically generate projects that meet the official requirements of Leviathan, which will greatly improve your efficiency.

pdm-lev does not provide an upgrade method for the time being, you need to upgrade manually:
```bash
$ pdm plugin remove pdm-lev
$ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
```



At this point, the environment configuration is complete, start the [next step](https://github.com/talentsec/lev_doc/blob/main/4.%20%E5%87%AD%E8%AF%81%E4%B8%8A%E4%BC%A0%E4%B8%8E%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96-en.md)
