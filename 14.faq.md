## FAQ

#### Why is it more recommended to build images on Leviathan?

  For the convenience of users, Leviathan provides the service of automatic image building, which will also facilitates tool review and the management of user image space. When the user uploads the Dockerfile to the associated GitHub repository, and automatically build the image, the tool image name in the code will be invoked with `.username.tool:tag`.
 
  If the image used by the user is built by a third party, the tool image name in the code must be entered in full to be invoked, such as `registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/levkit/checkdmarc:v5`. Tool review will take a longer time in this case.

  To use the tool, you need to start the corresponding tool container by invoking the image. The image created by the user needs to be uploaded and made public before it can be pulled and used by other users. Of course, the levrt library provided by Leviathan will query the user locally before the tool is executed. If the user needs to use a local image, it will be invoked directly. Otherwise, it will request the image repository platform uploaded by the tool author to pull. This process requires a smooth network. Please wait a moment.

#### Why should developers write a series of comments within tools and workflows?

  Firstly, the annotations in the tool and the workflow help the author to sort out the tool invocation and workflow execution process. It also helps the users to understand the purpose of the tool and the workflow, the meaning of the parameters and the overall logic. Secondly, Leviathan requires canonical annotations in tools and workflows for data parsing, which is used for front-end display and affects the classification of tools. Therefore, authors are requested to write the annotations according to the standard format provided by the document.


#### Why should I define a raw mode in the tool? 

  The raw mode is defined for users to use freely in advanced mode. Take the well-known nmap tool as an example. When nmap is invoked from the command line, various parameters can be attached, such as `-sP -sn`, etc. If these parameters are all defined as nmap mode, it will be very inconvenient for tool authors to build and for users to invoke. Under raw invocations, users can directly pass in the parameter list of `["-sP", "-sn", "192.168.1.1"]` , and use ping to scan the ip host of 192.168.1.1 without port scanning. When a tool is relatively simple to use and has fewer parameters, it is recommended that authors do not use raw mode. Instead, authors can directly define all the modes of the tool so that users can use the tool more directly and quickly.


#### Will entry() override ENTRYPOINT[]?

  `ENTRYPOINT[]` in the Dockerfile can be understood as a command that is automatically executed after the docker container has been started. In the tool definition mode, the entry() function will replace this command with the command about how the tool in the container should execute.


#### How will tool's output data be processed?

  The entry() function will process data as below.
  
1. `output = subprocess.checkout_put([], text=True)` invokes the tool to execute the command in the container, and returns the command standard output as the result data (output).

2. `subprocess.run([])` invokes the tool to execute the command in the container, and usually saves the result locally in the container in the format of other files (such as .txt, .json).

Next, the tool author can use Python to process string data to form a dictionary (result) containing the required result data, and then store the dictionary of result data into the database through the final `ctx.update(result)`.
  

#### How to specify the location for the tool output results to store?

  After the tool output is processed to a dictionary type, it will be stored in the mongodb database. And the storage space of the data in the database is specified by the parameter value in Cr( ), such as `szczecin/checkdmarc.raw:1.0`.


#### What is workflow? What's the meaning of writing a workflow?

  First of all, workflow can be understood as a purposeful task. This task needs to be completed by using many tools, so it can also be understood as the scheduling of tools. Previous chapters describe various writing methods of workflows. At the same time, it should be noted that the tool serves the workflow and the workflow is on top of the tool. One workflow can invoke multiple tools. For example, when the first tool obtains the output result under the workflow scheduling, the output result can be returned through the database invocation function and passed to the next tool for use. The writing of the workflow is similar to the scenario when we use Python, most of us will firstly import the library (tool), and then start to write the program (tool invocation).
  
#### What is the structure of a package?

  `\lev.username.tool\`  is a collection of tools, workflows and module calls uploaded by users. This entire folder is the package to be uploaded to Leviathan, including `tool.py` (tool module), `asset.py` (workflow module) and `__init__.py` (export module).


#### What configurations are enabled for talentsec/lev?

  After executing the talentsec/lev to build environment, it will build lev-mongo (mongo database container), lev-mongo-express (mongo database display container), lev-agent (remote link of Leviathan system container), lev- rt (data scheduling container in tool/workflow execution) and lev-lemon (data transmission to Leviathan front-end display container) locally.


#### What content does Leviathan Platform review? Why is tool review required?

  Considering the security of the platform and the privacy of other users, Leviathan will conduct a security review of the code in the package uploaded by all authors (including tool files, workflow invocations and comments, etc.) and the image invoked in the user's tool file. We must ensure when the package code uploaded by users is parsed, no malicious behavior will be triggered on the front end. Besides, we will ensure that the tool image will not perform malicious operations on the user's system. Therefore, it may need to wait for a certain review time before it can be published, displayed and used on Leviathan after the package has been uploaded.
