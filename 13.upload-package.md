## Upload the tool package and the workflow package

1. Delete the `main.py` used for the test in the `./lev-hub/username.tool`  directory or the `./lev-hub/username.asset`.
Then execute the uploading command, after approval [^10](#What content does Leviathan Platform review? Why is tool review required?).
In your personal warehouse, you can see the invocations of uploaded tools and workflows:

```bash
pdm lev upload
```

2. Update the tool and workflow version.
If there is an update after uploading the tools and workflows for the first time, you need to modify the code in the corresponding directory of the user's local tools and workflows.Then execute the uploading command again.
Please note that you need to modify the `pyproject.toml` file in the `./lev-hub/username.tool` directory the next time you want to upload updated contents.

```bash
[project]
name = "lev.szczecin.xray"
version = "0.1.0"	# Old version number
description = ""
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "levrt>=1.0.4",
]
...

[project]
name = "lev.szczecin.xray"
version = "0.1.1"	# New version number
description = ""
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "levrt>=1.0.4",
]
...

$ pdm lev upload
```

3. If the output result data has changed greatly after the tool and workflow are updated, the corresponding `models` version should also be updated.The version of `models` is the version that displays the output data, which can be inconsistent with the version of the tool (version in the pyproject.toml file):

```python
model: szczecin/checkdmarc.spf:1.0
---
model: szczecin/checkdmarc.spf:1.1
```

4. When the tool package and workflow package are uploaded to Leviathan, users can set the package in the warehouse "public" and publish it after the tool review. Then other users can use the command in the local workspace to obtain and invoke the published package:

```bash
# pdm add lev.username.tool
$ pdm add lev.szczecin.nmap_python

# pdm add lev.username.asset
$ pdm add lev.szczecin.checkdmarc
```
