## Reading Guide

### Tool user

If you only want to use tools, workflows, or toolkits published by other developers online, and do not need to perform development operations (e.g., writing and uploading toolkits, local testing, etc.) by yourself, then you only need to read the following three parts as in the User Guide:

* Docker installation
* SSH configuration(#Personal SSH public key upload)
* talentsec/lev launch(#talentsec/lev launch)


### Tool developer

If you find existing tools and workflows on LEV insufficient, and you have confidence in your development capabilities, the following contents will guide you about how to upload your own cybersecurity packages (i.e., tools/workflows) to LEV so that others can use:

* [3. Development environment configuration](3.configuration.md)
    * [3.1 Windows](3.1.windows.md)
    * [3.2 Mac](3.2.mac.md)
    * [3.3 Linux](3.3.linux.md)
* [4. Certification and token](4.credential.md)
* [5. Hello World](5.hello-world.md)
* [6. Upload the tool to LEV](6.nmap.md)
* [7. Update Hello World](7.multi-mode-nmap.md)
* [8. Add tool mode](8.image-management.md)
* [9. Image building](9.workflow.md)
* [10. Local testing](10.multiple-practices-of-workflow.md)
* [11. Image uploading](11.local-testing.md)
* [12. Workflow](12.remote-debugging.md)
* [13. Troubleshooting](13.upload-package.md)
* [14. FAQ](14.faq.md)
* [15. API reference](15.api.md)
