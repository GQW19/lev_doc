## The first tool on Leviathan

### 1. Hello World

#### 1.1 Create Hello World project

Create a new project using the pdm lev command

```bash
$ pdm lev new whtcjdtc2008.hello_world
```

Note: the project name format is `[name space].[project name]` , `whtcjdtc2008` in the above command is my `namespace on Leviathan`, you need to replace this part with `your namespace`.

As shown in the figure, the Hello World project is successfully created:

#### 1.2 Run Hello World

Open the terminal, enter the workspace folder, and execute `pdm run python main.py`

```bash
$ cd whtcjdtc2008.hello_world
$ pdm run python main.py
```

As you can see, the terminal says `Hello, world!`, and our first project runs successfully! Isn't that easy? (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

### 2. Project Analysis

#### 2.1 Project Directory Structure

The following is the automatically created directory structure, the ones to focus on are `lev/whtcjdtc2008/hello_world`、`pyproject.toml` and `main.py`.

```bash
./
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.10
│       ├── bin
│       ├── include
│       ├── lib
│       └── share
├── lev
│   └── whtcjdtc2008
│       └── hello_world # The core directory, the main tool/workflow code are placed here
│           ├── __init__.py
│           └── __pycache__
├── main.py # Local test files for local development, testing, running
└── pyproject.toml # The configuration file of the package, which records information such as version number, dependency library, and TOKEN
```

#### 2.2 Core code

##### 2.2.1 Tool invocation code

The source code of `main.py` is as follows:

```python
import levrt
from lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world import hello

async def main():
    doc = await hello()
    data = await doc.get()
    print(data["msg"])


if __name__ == "__main__":
    levrt.run(main())
```

As you can see, the source code of `main.py` is very simple, and the main body is divided into three parts:

The first part is as follows, mainly introducing two libraries, `levrt` and `hello`, where `levrt` is the core library of Leviathan, and `hello` is the tool created by the developer (that is, you).

```python
import levrt
from lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world import hello
```

The second part is as follows. This part of the code defines an asynchronous function `main`, which executes the tool `Hello` you just created, takes the return value of the tool, and prints it to Terminal.
```python
async def main():
    doc = await hello()
    data = await doc.get()
    print(data["msg"])
```

The third part is as follows, which is the main program entry of this file.
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    levrt.run(main())
```

##### 2.2.2 Tool code

The source code of `_init_.py` is as follows:

```python
import levrt
from levrt import Cr, annot, ctx
from levrt.annot.cats import Attck


@annot.meta(
    desc="Hello",
    params=[annot.Param("name", "person name")],
    cats=[Attck.Reconnaissance],
)
def hello(name: str = "world") -> Cr:
    @levrt.remote
    def entry():
        ctx.set(msg=f"Hello, {name}!")

    return Cr("alpine:latest", entry=entry())


__lev__ = annot.meta([hello])
```

It can be seen that the source code of `_init_.py` is also very simple, and the main body is also divided into three parts:

The first part is as follows, mainly introducing `levrt` and its class library. For the role of specific classes, please refer to the API interface documentation.

```python
import levrt
from levrt import Cr, annot, ctx
from levrt.annot.cats import Attck
```

The second part is as follows, this part of the code is used to define the tool we created, the function decorated with `@levrt.remote` will run in the container declared in the `Cr(...)` function.

```python
@annot.meta(
    desc="Hello",
    params=[annot.Param("name", "person name")],
    cats=[Attck.Reconnaissance],
)
def hello(name: str = "world") -> Cr:
    @levrt.remote
    def entry():
        ctx.set(msg=f"Hello, {name}!")

    return Cr("alpine:latest", entry=entry())
```

The third part is as follows, this part of the code is used to export the mode of the tool.

```python
__lev__ = annot.meta([hello])
```
