Let's use a simple example to demonstrate how to call Leviathan Platform SDK by using python code.

### 1. Basic configuration

#### 1.1 Create and initialize the workspace

First, create a workspace folder hello_world.

```bash
$ mkdir hello-world
```

Go to the folder and install the base Leviathan SDK:

```bash
$ cd hello-world
$ pdm init # Initialize the workspace folder, the necessary files will be generated
$ pdm add levrt
```

Then there will be a request to select the python interpreter version and other inputs. Don't worry, just press the enter key all the way down.

Until the prompt `changes are written to pyproject.toml` appears on the screen. It indicates that the initialization was successful.

#### 1.2 Add SDK

Then start installing Leviathan SDK-levrt:

```bash
$ pdm add levrt
```

Until the `All Complete` prompt appears, it indicates success

In this way, the initial environment configuration is completed, and the final directory structure will be:

```bash
hello-world/
├── pdm.lock
├── .pdm.toml			# Hidden file, generally not displayed
├── pyproject.toml
└── __package__/
```

### 

### 2. 2. Code HelloWorld

Create a new `main.py` file under the workspace (hello-world) and code as follows :

```python
import levrt
from levrt import Cr

def hello():
    return Cr("alpine:latest",cmd=["echo","hello,world"])


async def main():
    await hello()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    levrt.run(main ())
```

This step does not explain the specific meaning of the code for the time being. Let's firstly complete the following running steps.

### 3. Run HelloWorld

Open the terminal, enter the workspace folder, and directly call the python command to interpret and execute main.py.

```bash
$ cd hello-world
$ python3.10 main.py
```

If pdm is installed by the brew command under mac, you need to execute the command:

```bash
$ cd hello-world
$ pdm run python main.py
```

If no exception is reported and there is no response after the command is executed, it means the operation is successful.

### 4. View the running results

In Leviathan Platform SDK, all the tool invocation of the user runs in docker. If there is no output after the previous code is executed, then the final running result needs to be viewed in docker.

Enter the docker command:

```bash
$ docker ps -a
```

The content shown in the figure below will appear. The instance in red box is the instance of the running code:

![](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/6297a828-112b-4399-85e5-40aef7656e8c.JPEG)

Enter the command to print the log and to see the final result:

```bash
# 6d52 is the abbreviation for the ID of the docker instance in the above figure, or you can use the image name: "alpine:latest".
$ sudo docker logs -f 6d52 
hello,world
```

Successfully print out "HelloWorld" log.

Congratulations! You have successfully called Leviathan SDK once and printed "hello, world" in the container! The Long March begins with a single step, I believe you will soon be able to learn more advanced usage.



### 5. Code Analysis

```python
# Import Leviathan SDK - levrt package
import levrt
from levrt import Cr

# Main function method, execute core logic
def hello():
    # 执行结果写入docker中
    return Cr("alpine:latest", cmd=["echo", "hello,world"])

# Asynchronous method encapsulation, each function method of the user needs to be encapsulated by an asynchronous method 
async def main():
    await hello()

# Main function, program entry
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Call the SDK execution function
    levrt.run(main ())
```
